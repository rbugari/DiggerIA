# DiggerAI - Functional Specification (v3.2)

## 1. Executive Summary
**DiggerAI** is an AI-powered Reverse Engineering & Data Lineage platform designed to accelerate the understanding, documentation, and migration of complex data ecosystems. 

By leveraging Generative AI (LLMs) and Graph Database technology, DiggerAI transforms opaque legacy code (SQL, SSIS, Python) into interactive, navigable intelligence. This tool addresses the critical business challenge of "Data Knowledge Debt"—where the logic of critical business processes is locked inside code files that no one fully understands.

## 2. Business Value Proposition
*   **Accelerate Cloud Migrations:** Reduce the "Assessment & Planning" phase of migration projects by 40-60% by automatically mapping existing dependencies.
*   **Deep Logic Extraction:** Automatically translate legacy SSIS formulas and SQL scripts into modern dbt/SQL logic.
*   **Zero-Downtime Impact Analysis:** Visualize the "blast radius" of schema changes before they happen.
*   **Automate Documentation:** Replace stale, manual documentation with a living, AI-generated knowledge base and professional PDF reports.

## 3. Target Audience
*   **Data Architects:** For high-level system design, migration planning, and impact analysis.
*   **Data Engineers:** To deconstruct legacy ETL pipelines and debug complex logic field-by-field.
*   **Data Governance Officers:** To maintain an automated, auditable catalog of assets and lineage.

## 4. Key Features (Release v3.2)

### 4.1. Intelligent Code Ingestion & Planning
*   **Multi-Format Support:** Natively parses and analyzes SSIS (.dtsx), SQL (.sql), and Python/PySpark (.py).
*   **Interactive Planning Phase:** Users can review, categorize, and prioritize files before the heavy AI analysis begins, ensuring cost control and focus.

### 4.2. Advanced Hierarchical Lineage Graph
*   **Hierarchical Visualization (Containers):** Complex packages (like SSIS) are rendered as nested containers, logically grouping internal tasks and data flows.
*   **Auto-Layout & Context Isolation:** Intelligent DAG layout ensures readability. Users can "Drill-Down" into a specific package to isolate its internal logic.
*   **Persona-Based Perspectives:**
    *   **Architect View:** High-level "Map" showing only critical data assets (Tables, Views) and their macro-connections.
    *   **Engineer View:** Low-level "Circuit Diagram" showing every script, transformation, and logic block.

### 4.3. Visual Impact Analysis
*   **Blast Radius Discovery:** Select any node to instantly highlight all downstream dependencies (tables, reports, scripts) affected by a potential change.
*   **Animated Highlighting:** Affected paths are visually separated from the rest of the graph for maximum clarity.

### 4.4. AI-Powered Deep Metadata
*   **Automated Summaries:** AI-generated "Senior Engineer" summaries for every node.
*   **Logic Translator:** Automatically translate obscure SSIS expressions or SQL fragments into human-readable SQL or dbt code.
*   **Schema & Column Lineage:** Traces individual fields from source to destination.

### 4.5. Professional Reporting & Export
*   **PDF Solution Report:** Professional, multi-page audit report including executive summaries, component distributions, and full asset inventories.
*   **CSV Data Export:** Full metadata export for offline analysis or external governance tools.

## 5. Use Cases

### Case A: The "Black Box" Migration
**Scenario:** A retailer needs to migrate 500 SSIS packages to Databricks.
**Solution:** Using **Hierarchical Visualization**, the team identifies the exact tasks inside the packages that handle the core logic. They use the **Logic Translator** to generate dbt code directly from the SSIS formulas, saving hundreds of hours of manual rewriting.

### Case B: Preventive Impact Analysis
**Scenario:** A data steward needs to rename a core customer table.
**Solution:** They enable **Impact Mode**, click the table, and instantly see three downstream ETL containers and two financial reports that will break. They generate a **PDF Report** of the impact list to coordinate with the downstream teams.

### Case C: Business vs technical Onboarding
**Scenario:** A Project Manager wants to understand the warehouse without seeing the code.
**Solution:** They switch to **Architect Perspective**. The technical "noise" disappears, and they are left with a clean map of how data moves between business entities.

## 6. Design Objectives
1.  **Transparency:** Every visual relationship is backed by source code evidence.
2.  **Scalability:** From single scripts to entire enterprise repositories.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** Users govern the analysis plan and depth to manage costs.
