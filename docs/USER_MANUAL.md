# DiggerAI - User Manual (v3.2)

Welcome to DiggerAI. This manual will guide you through the process of reverse-engineering your data ecosystem and exploring its hidden logic.

## 🚀 1. Getting Started: Creating a Solution
A **Solution** is a workspace dedicated to a specific codebase (e.g., "Marketing DWH" or "Sales SSIS Migration").

1.  **Access the Dashboard:** Click on "Solutions" in the main menu.
2.  **Add New:** Click the "**+ New Solution**" button.
3.  **Configuration:**
    - **Name:** Enter a descriptive name.
    - **Path/URL:** Provide the local folder path containing your code or a Git Repository URL.
4.  **Initialize:** Click "Create". The system will begin the **Ingestion Phase**.

## 📋 2. The Planning Phase (Review & Approve)
DiggerAI doesn't just process everything—it builds a plan for you to review first.

1.  **View Plan:** Once ingestion is complete, your solution will show as "Ready to Approve". Click into it.
2.  **Review Items:** You will see files grouped into areas (Foundation, Packages, etc.).
    - **Toggle:** Uncheck files you don't want to analyze (to save cost/time).
    - **Estimates:** See the predicted time and token cost for each file.
3.  **Approve:** Once satisfied, click "**Approve & Execute**".

## 🕸️ 3. Exploring the Knowledge Graph
This is the heart of the platform. You can visualize how data flows through your system.

### 3.1 Perspectives: Architect vs. Engineer
Use the toggle in the top-right corner to change the level of detail:
- **Architect View:** Simplifies the graph to show only Tables and Databases. Ideal for high-level business maps.
- **Engineer View:** Shows every script, transformation, and task. Ideal for debugging and technical audits.

### 3.2 Impact Analysis (The "Blast Radius")
1.  Click the "**Impact Mode**" button (Sparkles icon) in the toolbar.
2.  **Select a Node:** Click on any table or script.
3.  **Result:** The graph will instantly highlight all downstream assets affected if that node changes. Everything else will dim.

### 3.3 Context Isolation (Drill-Down)
1.  In a complex graph, click on a **Package Container** (the large boxes grouping tasks).
2.  The view will **Focus** only on that package, hiding everything else.
3.  **Reset:** Click "**Reset Focus**" in the toolbar to return to the global map.

## 🤖 4. AI Deep Dive & Logic Translation
1.  **Select any Node:** A side panel appears with metadata.
2.  **AI Summary:** Read the "Senior Engineer" explanation of what that component does.
3.  **Logic Translator:** For SSIS transformations, you'll see original expressions. Click "**AI Translate to SQL**" to see how that logic would look in modern SQL or dbt code.

## 📄 5. Reporting & Exports
1.  **PDF Report:** Click the "**PDF Report**" button in the toolbar to download a professional audit summary of the entire solution.
2.  **CSV Export:** Use "**Export CSV**" to get a list of all assets and their metadata for Excel or external tools.

## 💬 6. Chatting with your Graph
Need to ask a specific question?
1.  Open the **Chat Assistant** in the bottom-right corner.
2.  **Ask Anything:**
    - *"What tables are modified by the 'LoadDimCustomer' script?"*
    - *"Show me the lineage for the SalesReporting view."*
    - *"Explain the business logic found in the Finance folder."*
